# React Ionic Experiment

Ionic has generally been used exclusively with Angular but lately it seems
they've been expanding and giving the developer more choices. I'm hoping to
create a small app that uses a few native APIs (camera and storage) and
eventually I'd like to do the same using React Native to compare them.

## References

Due to [@ionic/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic/react)
being in early stages, there's not much documentation surrounding
it so I'm primarily dissecting their
[sample app](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-react-conference-app) and
adapting their [Angular documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components).
